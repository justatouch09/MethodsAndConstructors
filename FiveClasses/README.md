This assignment is designed to flex our brand new class-writing skills. Before we get to that, though, take a moment to enjoy this animated gif of a man trying to feed some pigeons:

Ok, back to the assignment.

Here are your tasks:
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/TIY-Charlotte-Java/GitAndJavaBasics).
2. Clone your repository to your computer.
3. Use IntelliJ to create 5 different classes. Each class should have at least 5 different variables. Get creative!

Example:

```java
// Stores a single tweet.

public class Tweet {
    String text;
    String username;
    int timestamp;
    boolean isPrivate;
}
```

**HARDMODE**

Create the repository using your terminal first, then hook it up to your GitHub repository. I won't be able to tell that you did this, so just let me know what you did in the submission notes. Hint: It involves `git remote`


**ULTRAMODE**

Make a few methods inside each class that you created. In the main class, use instances of those objects to invoke those methods.
